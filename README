This git project is (yet another) attempt
to build a pure functional programming framework
for Scala.

To start with I have written traits for the concepts
that are dealt with in the paper 
Applicative Programming with Effects
(http://www.soi.city.ac.uk/~ross/papers/Applicative.html).

I have written the traits using a programming style
that is similar to the style I used for some blogs
on monad transformers
(http://lucdup.blogspot.com/2009/12/monad-transformers-example.html).
